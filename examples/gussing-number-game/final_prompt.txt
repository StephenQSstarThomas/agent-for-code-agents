**Project Context**  
The Guessing Number Game is designed to offer a simple yet engaging experience where players guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10, with up to 5 attempts. The objective is to develop a user-friendly game that provides instant feedback, promoting user engagement and satisfaction. Success is measured by user engagement rates, average session duration, and user feedback.

### CODING PROTOCOL ###  
Development Guidelines:
- Use minimal code to complete current task
- No large-scale refactoring
- No unrelated edits, focus on current development task
- Code must be precise, modular, and testable
- Do not break existing functionality
- If you need me to do any configuration (e.g., Supabase/AWS) please tell me explicitly

Focus on implementing the core game mechanics and user interface as outlined in the project documents, ensuring adherence to coding protocols and project requirements.
