# Guessing Number Game: Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for developing a simple guessing number game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player is given 5 chances to guess the correct number. This game aims to provide a fun and engaging experience while maintaining simplicity and accessibility for users of all ages.

## Project Overview & Vision
- **Objective**: Create an interactive and user-friendly guessing game that promotes engagement and provides instant feedback to players.
- **Success Metrics**: User engagement rates, average time spent per session, and user satisfaction ratings.
- **Market Positioning**: Positioned as a casual game for short breaks and leisure, with the potential for expansion into educational environments.

## Comprehensive Requirements Engineering

### Functional Requirements
1. **Random Number Generation**
   - The system must generate a random number between 1 and 10 at the start of each game session.
   - Acceptance Criteria: The generated number is uniformly distributed across the range.

2. **User Input**
   - The system must allow users to input their guess through a user-friendly interface.
   - Acceptance Criteria: The interface must accept integer inputs only and provide feedback for invalid inputs.

3. **Guess Validation**
   - The system must compare the user's guess against the generated number.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Provide feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

4. **Guess Attempts**
   - Users have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
   - Acceptance Criteria: The system tracks and displays the number of remaining attempts.

5. **Game Conclusion**
   - The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or exhausts all attempts.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Display a message indicating the game's outcome and offer an option to play again.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system must respond to user inputs within 200 milliseconds.
- **Usability**: The game interface must be intuitive and accessible for all age groups.
- **Scalability**: Although designed as a single-player game, the architecture should support potential expansion to multiplayer modes.

### Integration Requirements
- The game can be integrated into a larger gaming platform or website with minimal adjustments.

## User Experience Architecture

### User Personas
- **Casual Gamer**: Looks for quick and easy games to play during breaks.
- **Educator**: Uses simple games to engage students in interactive learning.

### User Stories
- As a player, I want immediate feedback on my guesses so that I can adjust my strategy.
- As a player, I want to know how many attempts I have left so that I can manage my guesses.

### Accessibility Requirements
- The game must be accessible via multiple devices, including desktop and mobile.
- The interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for accessibility.

## Technical Foundation Analysis

### Security and Compliance
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations if user data is collected.

### Integration Architecture
- An API endpoint can be provided for integrating the game with third-party platforms.

## Scope Boundaries & Constraints
- **Inclusion**: Single-player mode, number range between 1 and 10, 5 attempts.
- **Exclusion**: Multiplayer functionality, advanced graphics, and animations.
- **Constraints**: Limited to browser-based implementation initially.

## Success Metrics & KPIs
- **Engagement Rate**: Measure the number of sessions per user.
- **User Satisfaction**: Collect feedback through surveys post-game.
- **Performance**: Track response times and system uptime.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Develop core game mechanics and user interface.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement accessibility features and optimize for performance.
3. **Phase 3**: Conduct user testing and gather feedback.
4. **Phase 4**: Launch and monitor user engagement metrics.

## Risk Assessment Matrix
- **Technical Risk**: Delays in response time could lead to user frustration.
  - Mitigation: Conduct performance testing before launch.
- **User Risk**: Lack of engagement may result in low adoption.
  - Mitigation: Gather user feedback to improve game mechanics.

By adhering to these comprehensive specifications, the development team can ensure that the guessing number game is engaging, accessible, and technically sound.
