## CODING PROTOCOL
### Development Guidelines:
- Use minimal code to complete current task
- No large-scale refactoring
- No unrelated edits, focus on current development task
- Code must be precise, modular, and testable
- Do not break existing functionality
- If you need me to do any configuration (e.g. Supabase/AWS) please tell me explicitly

Ensure you reference the architecture and task plan files to align your development efforts with the project's overall design and objectives. Maintain focus on the current task while adhering strictly to the coding protocol to optimize both the development process and the resulting application functionality.
